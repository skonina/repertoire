# Repertoire

Fancy calendar which can display various events based on users preference. Built to serve as a central hub for Polish *(multi-city functionality)* Theatres Repertoires.

Easy to use as a pie, just register new event providers (*theatres*) and add events in Database folder to the corresponding city .JSON file. All the rest generated on the fly :sparkles: thanks to grunt which produces three lightweight minified files in the dist folder!

Built upon awesome [CLNDR](https://kylestetz.github.io/CLNDR/)
