# Repertoire

Fancy calendar which can display various events based on users preference. Built to serve as a central hub for Polish (*multi-city functionality*) Theatres Repertoires.

Easy to use as a pie, just register new event providers (*theatres*) and add events in Database folder to the corresponding city .JSON file. All the rest generated on the fly :sparkles: 

Built upon awesome [CLNDR](https://kylestetz.github.io/CLNDR/)
